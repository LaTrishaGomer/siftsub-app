# SiftSub â€“ Subscription Tracker

Itâ€™s easy to lose track of your online subscriptions. You sign up for a free trial, forget to cancel, and before you know it, you're spending way more than you realized.

Thatâ€™s where SiftSub comes in. Itâ€™s a simple subscription tracking app that helps you sift through your recurring charges so you can see whatâ€™s worth keeping and whatâ€™s draining your wallet.

SiftSub lets you log your monthly subscriptions, see whatâ€™s due soon, and track your spending patterns over time.

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

I plan to add more features to improve the app, which includes:

- Add recurring billing logic so subscriptions automatically renew each month  
- Archive canceled subscriptions while keeping historical payment data  
- Include push or email reminders for upcoming renewal dates  
- Improve dashboard with filters (e.g. by category, active/canceled status)  
- Add categories/tags for better subscription organization
